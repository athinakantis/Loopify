# Loopify

An app to help users discover new music based on their mood.

## Background

We are a group of 5 Full-Stack Web Development students from Business College Helsinki who decided to work together to make a Mood playlist generator using the Spotify API.

## Features

-   Search and play music
-   Filter playlists based on users mood
-   Playlist creation

## Technologies used

-   React
-   Spotifty API

## Known Flaws

### - Accesstoken doesn't automatically renew

Because of the 9 week limit, we made the decision to focus on the front-end experience and getting more familiar with API-calls and React. This unfortunately means there is no automatic renewal for the accesstoken and the user has to refresh after the token expires (1 hour)
